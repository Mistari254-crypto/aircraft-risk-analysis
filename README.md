Aircraft Risk Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes aircraft accident and risk data to assess safety levels and provide insights for aviation expansion. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning, imputation, and visualization, and Tableau for interactive dashboard creation, this study classifies aircraft risk levels based on various parameters.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains 88,889 records of aircraft incidents, including details like:

Event Information: Date, Location, Country

Aircraft Details: Make, Model, Engine Type, Flight Hours

Incident Severity: Fatal Injuries, Minor Injuries, Uninjured

Weather Conditions & Flight Phase

🔍 Data Analysis & Key Steps

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Handled missing values

Converted relevant columns to correct data types

Created new features (e.g., accident rates per flight hours)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized accident distribution

Assessed trends based on flight phases, weather conditions, and aircraft types

Used histograms, bar charts, and pie charts for key insights

3️⃣ Risk Classification Model

Applied Random Forest Classifier to categorize aircraft risk levels

Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and classification reports

4️⃣ Tableau Dashboard

Interactive dashboard showcasing accident trends, high-risk aircraft, and key insights

Filters for date, location, aircraft type, and severity

📌 Visualizations & Insights

🔹 High-risk aircraft models were identified based on accident frequency and severity.🔹 Weather conditions (IMC vs. VMC) played a crucial role in accident rates.🔹 Approach & Landing phases were the most accident-prone stages of flight.
